3.5.2 Calculation
It is very common to compare the RTDs by their moments instead of trying to compare their distributions. For this purpose three moments are normally used. The first is the mean residence time. The second moments commonly used is taken about the mean and is called the variance or square of the standard deviation. Magnitude of this moments is an indication of the spread of the distribution; the greater the value of this moment, the greatr a distribution’s spread or greater deviation from ideality. 

4. Conclusions
RTD experiment was carried out and concentration vs time data was developed from this data, reactor was characterized by calculating mean residence time, variance and dispersion number. C and E curve was plotted.
