3.5.2 Calculation
It is very common to compare the RTDs by their moments instead of
 trying to compare their distributions. For this purpose three moments
 are normally used. The first is the mean residence time. The second
 moments commonly used is taken about the mean and is called the
 variance or square of the standard deviation. Magnitude of this
 moments is an indication of the spread of the distribution; the
 greater the value of this moment, the greatr a distribution’s
 spread or greater deviation from ideality. 

4. Conclusions
RTD experiment was carried out and concentration vs time data was
 developed from this data, reactor was characterized by calculating
 mean residence time, variance and dispersion number. C and E curve
 was plotted.
